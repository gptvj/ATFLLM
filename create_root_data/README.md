In this directory, I have divided it into three subdirectories with three distinct tasks as follows:
- Law2Contract: Used to generate contracts from laws.
- Contract2Law: Used to find relevant laws in the corpus based on the input contract.
- MergeData: A directory for aggregating data to create the final dataset.

Note: This is only a sample for creating data and not the entire process for generating the complete dataset.

I hope this sample provides you with a clear and comprehensive overview of how we create our data.
